# Responsive_Portfolio

## This is my responsive portfolio site. The Main page will display links to 2 other pages titled 'Contact' and 'Portfolio'. 
## The main page will have a personal 'About Me' with a picture and an area where I will fill in some details about my life at a later time.  For now there is Ipsum Loren 
## occupying the space. It also includes 2 links to my Linkedin and GitHub.  When a user looks at my page(s) it should repsond to various device screens such and tablets and 
## mobiles. 
## The Portfolio page holds 2 pictures of Maine Coons until I can begin to build an actual portfolio.  This page also links to Home and Contact.
## The Contact page holds a simple form to allow someone to send a message to me.  As of now, the form is dead. There is no backend code to support a message being sent.
## 
## Doing this project, I learned that I was over-coding some areas. I was too focused on little parts responding to screen size.  A few wrappers cleaned up many and the pages
## resonded consistently after that.

## Special thanks to my tutor Tyler Bolty for helping me clean up the main page.
